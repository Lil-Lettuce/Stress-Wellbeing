    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
      Stress is a common issue among students and can affect academic performance,
      mental health, and physical wellbeing. This project focuses on understanding
      stress and identifying practical ways students can reduce and manage it.
    </p>

    <h2>What Is Stress?</h2>
    <p>
      According to the World Health Organization (WHO), stress is a state of worry or
      mental tension caused by challenging situations (WHO, 2023).
    </p>
    <p>
      Stress is not always harmful. Eustress can be motivating, while distress
      occurs when stress becomes overwhelming or constant (APA, 2022).
    </p>

  <section class="card">
    <h2>Why Stress Should Be Addressed</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Can negatively affect physical health (APA, 2022)</li>
      <li>Can reduce concentration and memory (APA, 2022)</li>
      <li>May impact long-term mental wellbeing (WHO, 2023)</li>
    </ul>

      <p>
        Our survey results showed that many students experience stress regularly,
        particularly during examination periods. Prolonged stress can reduce
        concentration, impair memory, and lower academic confidence. Over time,
        this can lead to burnout and reduced motivation, affecting both academic
        performance and overall wellbeing.

        International Education.

    <h2>The Bathtub Model</h2>
    <p>
      Stress can be compared to water in a bathtub. Stress levels increase when
      inflow is high and decrease when outflow is increased.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Reducing inflow focuses on preventing stress</li>
      <li>Increasing outflow focuses on relieving stress</li>
    </ul>

    <button class="expand-btn" onclick="toggleExplanation('bathtub-info')">Show more</button>
    <div class="explanation" id="bathtub-info">
      <p>
        This model explains why stress can quickly become overwhelming for students.
        When factors such as academic workload, lack of sleep, and exam pressure
        increase at the same time, stress accumulates rapidly. Without effective
        coping strategies, stress is not released, leading to distress.
      </p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h2>Reducing Stress Inflow (Prevention)</h2>

    <h3>Sleep</h3>
    <p>
      Poor sleep increases stress hormones such as cortisol. Maintaining a
      consistent sleep routine can help reduce stress.
    </p>

    <button class="expand-btn" onclick="toggleExplanation('sleep-info')">Show more</button>
    <div class="explanation" id="sleep-info">
      <p>
        According to our survey, approximately 30% of students reported sleeping
        fewer than five hours per night. Insufficient sleep affects emotional
        regulation and concentration, making students more vulnerable to stress,
        particularly during periods of high academic demand such as examinations.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h3>Managing Workload</h3>
    <p>
      Procrastination and poor planning can lead to overwhelming stress.
      Managing workload consistently helps reduce academic pressure.
    </p>

    <button class="expand-btn" onclick="toggleExplanation('workload-info')">Show more</button>
    <div class="explanation" id="workload-info">
      <p>
        Workload and exam pressure were identified as the most significant sources
        of stress in our survey. When work is delayed, tasks accumulate closer to
        deadlines, increasing pressure. Planning work into smaller, achievable
        tasks helps reduce this build-up and gives students a greater sense of
        control.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h3>Physical Activity</h3>
    <p>
      Physical activity can improve mood and reduce stress by supporting overall
      physical and mental health.
    </p>

    <button class="expand-btn" onclick="toggleExplanation('exercise-info')">Show more</button>
    <div class="explanation" id="exercise-info">
      <p>
        Regular physical activity supports emotional regulation and helps release
        tension. Even low-intensity activities, such as walking, can provide a
        healthy outlet for stress and improve focus when returning to academic
        tasks.

    <h2>Reducing Stress Outflow (Coping)</h2>
    <p>
      Coping mechanisms are methods individuals use to respond to stress.
      These methods are subjective and vary between individuals.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Listening to music or podcasts</li>
      <li>Meditation</li>
      <li>Exercise</li>
      <li>Journaling</li>
      <li>Talking to trusted people</li>
    </ul>

    <button class="expand-btn" onclick="toggleExplanation('coping-info')">Show more</button>
    <div class="explanation" id="coping-info">
      <p>
        Our survey showed that listening to music and talking to friends were among
        the most common coping strategies used by students. Coping mechanisms are
        highly personal, meaning students often need to experiment to find methods
        that effectively reduce stress without causing additional harm.
      </p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h2>Social Media and Coping</h2>
    <p>
      Social media can be helpful in moderation, but excessive use may become
      maladaptive due to its addictive nature.
    </p>

    <button class="expand-btn" onclick="toggleExplanation('social-info')">Show more</button>
    <div class="explanation" id="social-info">
      <p>
        According to our survey, 63% of students reported using social media as a
        coping mechanism. While moderate use may provide temporary distraction,
        excessive use can increase comparison, reduce productivity, and reinforce
        stress rather than relieve it.
      </p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      While effective stress-management methods differ between individuals,
      combining prevention and coping strategies can significantly improve
      student wellbeing. Long-term stress should be addressed with external
      support where necessary.
